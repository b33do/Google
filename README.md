# Google Holiday Search Clone

A festive, feature-rich recreation of the Google home page inspired by the seasonal Christmas doodles. The project reimagines the familiar search experience with holiday theming, interactive UI polish, and lightweight enhancements built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## ✨ Features

- **Holiday doodle experience** – Custom letter styling, animated lights, and gentle snowfall evoke Google's Christmas celebrations.
- **Interactive search bar** – Autocomplete suggestions, keyboard navigation, a clear input shortcut, and support for "I'm Feeling Lucky".
- **Curated holiday content** – Quick search shortcuts, trending holiday topics, and seasonal highlight cards.
- **Responsive & accessible** – Works across screen sizes with semantic markup, focus states, and reduced-motion support.

## 🗂️ Project structure

```
├── index.html   # Page structure and content
├── style.css    # Holiday theme, layout, animations, and responsive design
├── script.js    # Search behaviour, suggestions, and trending data rendering
└── README.md    # Project overview and usage details
```

## 🚀 Getting started

1. Clone the repository (or download the source).
2. Open `index.html` directly in your browser **or** run a simple static server:
   ```bash
   python -m http.server 8000
   ```
3. Navigate to `http://localhost:8000` in your browser to explore the holiday Google experience.

## 🛠️ Customisation tips

- Update the `suggestionData` and `trendingSearches` arrays in `script.js` with your own seasonal ideas.
- Swap out the doodle styling or colors in `style.css` to match different holiday themes.
- Add new highlight cards or quick links in `index.html` to spotlight more content.
